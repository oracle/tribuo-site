        <h2>Get Started with Notebooks</h2>
        <p>
            New to Tribuo? Start out by following the <a  href="irises-tribuo-v4.html">Classification Tutorial</a>
            to learn the ropes. It introduces the ins and outs of training and testing a model as well as loading
            and saving the model for future use. To learn more about the basic features of Tribuo, se the menu
            on the left to navigate through the other tutorials.
        </p>

            <div class="ml-4 mb-4 alert alert-note">
            All the tutorials for Tribuo are available as Jupyter notebooks. While Jupyter does not natively
            support Java, you can add Java support via the <a href="https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava">IJava</a>
            kernel. Our tutorial notebooks make use of Java's <code>var</code> keyword, so you'll need to use at
            least Java 10 with IJava. Tribuo itself supports Java 8 and newer.

        <h2>Adding Tribuo to your Build</h2>
        <p>
            Ready to move on beyond notebooks and starting using Tribuo in a project? Tribuo is divided up into
            many modules that allow you to load only the parts of the library that you need. This is useful both
            in terms of limiting the size and scope of the jars you use, but it also allows you to, for example,
            exclude the pieces of Tribuo that rely on native dependencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            While you're still getting familiar with Tribuo though, the easiest way to get started is to use
            the <code>tribuo-all</code> dependency which references all the pieces of Tribuo and the dependencies
            on third-party components.
