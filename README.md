# tribuo-site

This repo hosts the website for the [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org)
Java Machine Learning Library. Please visit the [Tribuo GitHub Repo](https://github.org/oracle/tribuo)
to report issues.

# Updating the website

The tribuo-site relies on having the tribuo repo present as a
submodule. When cloning this repo, be sure to use
`git clone --recurse-submodules <url>`.

Some of the content in the site is generated automatically from
the Tribuo repo. This is done by running two scripts (which should
be re-run any time the tribuo repo is updated to prepare a website update):

```console
$ bin/importDocs.sh
$ bin/importTutorials.sh
```

Finally, changes to tribuo.css or notebook.css must be shrunk down
into the .min.css files. This can be done with a tool such as
[CSSO](https://github.com/css/csso). If your IDE supports it, you
can have it watch the .css files and automatically generate the
minified files whenever they change.

## To test locally

The first time you check out the code, you'll want to install
the dependencies with

```console
$ bundle install  # Just the first time
```

Then you can generate the site and run the web server with

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Now, open [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
